# Welcome to My Academic Website

## Researcher
I'm currently a Researcher at TCS Research in the Data and Decision Sciences Research Area. My work is fueled by a genuine passion for harnessing the potential of machine learning and operational research to address complex, real-world challenges. Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to bridging the gap between theory and practical solutions, and I bring with me a wide-ranging skill set that covers various domains. This includes my in-depth expertise in reinforcement learning and its diverse applications, ranging from robust power network control to optimizing supply chains, facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading, and remaining at the cutting edge of innovations in electric vehicle technology.
